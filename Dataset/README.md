The Early Disease Prediction Website is a web application that uses linear regression to predict diseases based on 17 input symptoms. Built with Python, Flask, and Scikit-learn, it allows users to input symptom values (0 or 1) through a simple web interface and receive a predicted disease. The model is trained on a synthetic dataset of 4940 records and 41 diseases, evaluating performance with metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, and accuracy. The app is easy to deploy locally and can be further improved with advanced algorithms, real-world datasets, and cloud deployment for wider access.
