This project focuses on building an early disease prediction website that uses linear regression to identify potential diseases based on user-inputted symptoms. It is powered by a dataset containing 41 diseases and 17 symptoms with 4940 records. The machine learning model is trained and evaluated using metrics like mean squared error, R-squared, and accuracy. The web interface, built using Flask, allows users to input symptoms and receive a predicted disease, offering an accessible tool for preliminary diagnosis.
